A Comprehensive Survey On Advanced Technologies For Enhancing Efficiency In Ocean Energy Harvesting.
This repository contains the research materials and findings for our survey paper on the advanced technologies transforming ocean energy harvesting.

üìñ About The Project
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of existing and emerging technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of ocean energy harvesting. With oceans covering 71% of the Earth's surface, the utilization of tidal currents, waves, and thermal gradients is a key pathway toward a zero-carbon future, aligning with UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Clean and Affordable Energy). Our work explores how recent advancements in AI, IoT, and nanoelectronics are overcoming challenges like resource variability and device efficiency to create sustainable and intelligent ocean energy systems.



üöÄ Technologies Explored
This survey covers a wide range of cutting-edge solutions:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT)

Predictive Analytics: AI models can be used for accurate forecasting of tides by analyzing historical and real-time data. One study proposes using an LSTM-DE model architecture for reliable real-time wave height prediction.



Digital Twins: AI-powered Digital Twins of the Ocean can be trained with existing data on wave height and pressure to predict upcoming wave conditions.


Real-Time Optimization: An IoT sensor connected to a prototype can detect motion from waves, with readings sent to a cloud system where an AI model predicts wave characteristics and directs the Wave Energy Converter (WEC) to adapt accordingly.

Nanoelectronics & Nanogenerators
The survey analyzes various nanogenerators that offer scalable and cost-effective energy harvesting:



Piezoelectric Nanogenerators (PENG): These harvesters use vibrations to turn them into electricity, allowing them to be independent of battery sources.


Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs): TENGs convert mechanical energy into electrical energy through triboelectrification and electrostatic induction. They are cost-effective, have a simplistic structure, high energy conversion efficiency, and can harvest power under low-frequency conditions.



Hydrovoltaic Generators: These environmentally friendly generators use evaporation to propel water through nanochannels, converting ambient heat into electricity.

The survey also covers 

Electromagnetic Generators (EMG), Dielectric Elastomer Generators (DEG), and Hybrid Nanogenerators.


Intermittent Computing
This method aims to tolerate power failures from inconsistent energy sources like tides, resuming work when energy returns. It is ideal for batteryless IoT devices that can be made in smaller parts to execute tasks efficiently even when power is intermittent.



üáÆüá≥ Focus on India's Potential
With a long coastline stretching 7500 km, India has enormous potential for ocean energy harvesting. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has identified considerable ocean energy potential across the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, and the Bay of Bengal.
